                Hello, I'm Tim Wallace, a web developer with a love for coding, bikes, photography, and music—especially playing the trombone. I discovered programming during the COVID-19 pandemic while creating a website for my band. Raised in vibrant Toronto, this marked a new chapter in my exploration of web development.
                Crafting a digital space for my band became a source of solace and inspiration, showcasing our music and sparking a broader passion for coding. Away from the screen, I find joy in cycling through Toronto's streets or on scenic trails, balancing the digital with the freedom of the open road.
                Photography is another passion, allowing me to capture the beauty of the world with my keen eye. Whether it's urban landscapes or the great outdoors, my photographs tell stories without words.
                When not immersed in the digital realm or exploring through my camera lens, you'll find me in the world of music, often playing the trombone. Whether experimenting with genres or attending live performances, music is a constant inspiration.
                In a world where technology and creativity converge, my journey is a harmonious blend of coding, music, cycling, and photography—a testament to the transformative power of passion where the digital and analog seamlessly come together.
